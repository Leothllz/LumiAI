Several tools exist to overcome these barriers and to create incentives towards electric end uses. Efficiency standards in buildings and vehicles greatly contribute, as do realigning subsidies and taxes so the business case becomes more favourable.\n3\nTarget RD&D on the electrification of industry\nChevron down\nThe technical potential for electrification in industry is high, but significant innovation and deployment is required to decrease the cost of alternative technologies. As the industry landscape is very diverse, the many benefits of electrification in industry may not be well-known to all industrial producers. Quantifying the benefits of electrification and adjusting industry standards for new equipment would help shift the paradigm in light industries.\nLast update on 11 July 2023\nAuthors and contributors\nRelated content\nAll\nReports\nNews and commentaries\nAll results\ncircle-arrow\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023\nFlagship report   — April 2023\nCredible pathways to 1.5°C\nFour pillars for action "},{"doc_id":"/Users/leo/lumi_project/data/electrification.txt","text":"rs and contributors\nRelated content\nAll\nReports\nNews and commentaries\nAll results\ncircle-arrow\nGlobal EV Outlook 2023\nFlagship report   — April 2023\nCredible pathways to 1.5°C\nFour pillars for action in the 2020s\nReport   — April 2023\nElectricity Market Report 2023\nFuel report   — February 2023\nGrid Integration of Electric Vehicles\nA manual for policy makers\nTechnology report   — December 2022\nIs the energy crisis really making the business case for heat pumps?\nFuel report   — December 2022\nThe Future of Heat Pumps\nTechnology report   — November 2022\nThe global energy crisis is driving a surge in heat pumps, bringing energy security and climate benefits\nNews   — 30 November 2022\nElectricity Security Policy\nFuel report   — June 2022\nElectricity Market Report - January 2022\nFuel report   — January 2022\nThe Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions\nFlagship report   — May 2021\nSecure energy transitions in the power sector\nPart of Electricity Security 2021\nFuel report   — April 2021\nPower Systems in Transition\nChallenges and opportunities ahead for electricity security\nFuel report   — October 2020\nUK and seven major companies join campaign for vehicle electrification\nNews   — 11 September 2018\nComparative Study on Rural Electrification Policies in Emerging Economies\nReport   — March 2010\nPrevious slide\nNext slide\nExplore more\nEnergy system\ncircle-arrow\nElectric Vehicles\nHeat Pumps\nSmart Grids\nPrevious slide\nNext slide\nThe Energy Mix\nGet updates on the IEA’s latest new"},{"doc_id":"/Users/leo/lumi_project/data/electrification.txt","text":"t   — March 2010\nPrevious slide\nNext slide\nExplore more\nEnergy system\ncircle-arrow\nElectric Vehicles\nHeat Pumps\nSmart Grids\nPrevious slide\nNext slide\nThe Energy Mix\nGet updates on the IEA’s latest news, analysis, data and events delivered twice monthly.\nError\nSubscribe\nView sample\nExplore our other newsletters\nBrowse\nTopics\nCountries & regions\nEnergy system\nProgrammes\nExplore\nReports\nData & statistics\nLearn\nAbout\nNews and commentaries\nEvents\nGlossary\nConnect\nContact\nPress\nJobs\narrow-north-east\nDelegates\narrow-north-east\nFollow\nx (formally twitter)\nfacebook\nlinkedin\nyoutube\ninstagram\nbluesky\nIEA\n©IEA 2025\nTerms\nPrivacy\nBack to top\nAuthors and contributors\nClose dialog\nLead authors\nMathilde Huismans\nContributors\nFabian Voswinkel"},{"doc_id":"/Users/leo/lumi_project/data/energy_guard.txt","text":"Home\nAbout us\nResources\nNews & Events\nDissemination Materials\nJoin our community\nGet in touch\nSelect Page\n#POWERINGTOMORROW\nWe test AI solutions for the energy sector\nEnergyGuard is creating 5 Testing and Experimentation Facilities across Europe to help SME, startups and entrepreneurs test and validate their AI solutions so they can reach the energy market.\nJoin the waitlist\nWhat can we do for you?\nValidation and demonstration\nSMEs, startups and entrepreneurs can test and experiment AI solutions for the energy market in real-world environments\nPhysical and virtual facilities\nSMEs, startups and entrepreneurs have access to large-scale physical and virtual reference sites open to all developers across Europe.\nSupport for full integration\nSMEs, startups and entrepreneurs get all resources and assistance necessary to incorporate AI solutions into existing energy market systems and infrastructure.\nMission & Vision\nMaking AI safe and useful for Energy\nWith different Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) across Europe, our mission is to build a shared space where companies and entrepreneurs can test and improve their AI solutions for the energy sector.

One example would be ending the double charging of taxes or certain grid fees.\nTransmission and distribution investment deferral (using storage to improve the utilisation of, and manage bottlenecks in, the power grid) is another potential high-value application for storage, since it can reduce the need for costly grid upgrades. To capture the greatest benefit, storage should be considered in the transmission and distribution planning process, along with other non-wire alternatives. A key issue is ownership: in many markets, storage is considered a generation asset and system operators (transmission as well as distribution) are not allowed to own storage assets. One solution is to allow them to procure storage services from third parties.

However, a number of technological and regulatory challenges remain for second-life applications to grow at scale. Chief among them is their ability to compete on price given the rapidly falling cost of new systems, although recent surges in the cost of battery minerals could improve the viability of recycling and reuse. Retired batteries need to undergo costly refurbishing processes to be used in new applications, and a lack of standardisation and streamlining of measuring the state of health of used batteries (e.g. storage condition, remaining capacity) further complicates the economics.

Now, fresh momentum around the world has the potential to open a new era for nuclear energy.\nPower generation from the global fleet of nearly 420 active nuclear reactors is set to reach a record high in 2025 as Japan restarts production, maintenance works are completed in France, and new reactors begin commercial operations in various markets, including China, Europe, India and Korea. Meanwhile, more than 60 nuclear reactors are currently under construction – representing over 70 gigawatts (GW) of capacity – and governments’ interest in nuclear power is at its highest level since the oil crisis in the 1970s, reflecting efforts to bolster energy security, accelerate clean energy transitions and meet rising demand for electricity. Over 40 countries now have plans to expand its use.\nThe Path to a New Era for Nuclear Energy\ncircle-arrow\nNuclear power capacity by region in the Announced Pledges Scenario, 2010-2050\nOpen\nexpand\nTracking Nuclear Electricity\nMore efforts needed\nNuclear power is an important low-emission source of electricity, providing about 10% of global electricity generation.

Lifetime extensions of existing nuclear power plants are one of the most cost-effective sources of low-emission electricity, and there have been several positive policy developments to take full advantage of these opportunities including in the United States, France and Japan. Additional effort is needed to accelerate new constructions – 8 GW of new nuclear capacity was brought online in 2022, but the Net Zero Scenario calls for over four-times as much annual deployment by 2030.

As power systems decarbonise and the share of solar and wind rises, SMRs can contribute to meeting rising power system flexibility needs.

Between 2018 and 2023, solar PV and wind capacity more than doubled, while their share of electricity generation almost doubled.\nMaximising the benefits from increased solar PV and wind capacity requires effective integration into power systems. While power systems have always managed demand variability, variable renewable energy (VRE) such as wind and solar PV introduces supply variability depending on the weather.\nThis variability will require increasing the flexibility of the entire power system, by leveraging dispatchable generation, grid enhancements, increased storage and demand response. Successful integration maximises the amount of energy that can be sourced securely and affordably, minimises costly system stability measures, and reduces dependency on fossil fuels.\nIntegrating Solar and Wind\ncircle-arrow\nCountries in phases of variable renewables integration, 2023-2030\nOpen\nexpand\nSix phases of system "},{"doc_id":"/Users/leo/lumi_project/data/renewable-integration.txt","text":" stability measures, and reduces dependency on fossil fuels.\nIntegrating Solar and Wind\ncircle-arrow\nCountries in phases of variable renewables integration, 2023-2030\nOpen\nexpand\nSix phases of system integration\nThe integration of VRE can be categorised into a framework made of six different phases, which can be used to prioritise different measures to support system flexibility, identify relevant challenges and implement appropriate measures to support the system integration of VRE.\nPower system flexibility refers to the capability of a power system to maintain continuous service in the face of rapid and large swings in supply or demand, whatever the cause. Flexibility has always been an important requirement for power systems due to the need to plan for unexpected contingencies such as plant and transmission outages. However system flexibility has become increasingly important for policy makers as the share of VRE generation increases and needs to be addressed in all time domains from real-time operations to long-term system planning.\nPhase 1 captures very early stages where VRE deployment has no immediate impact on power system operation. Phase 2 flexibility issues emerge but the system is able to cope with them through minor operational modifications.

The challenge for regulators is to resolve the asymmetry of lengthy grid permitting times and the imperative for shorter lags in implementing renewables.\nPublic acceptance of large infrastructure developments is another hurdle for grid expansion. Some project developers and authorities have reacted by introducing measures to limit the visible impacts of grid infrastructure, for example by insisting on the use of underground cables instead of overhead lines. Nonetheless, project developers need to pay close attention to the needs of local communities and involve them in the process as early as possible.\nLegal and regulatory frameworks should shape a change in mindset, avoiding the risks of under-investment and bottlenecks by improving integrated planning processes (for supply, demand and flexibility) and establishing adequate remuneration to incentivise smart grid de"},{"doc_id":"/Users/leo/lumi_project/data/smart-grids.txt","text":"oiding the risks of under-investment and bottlenecks by improving integrated planning processes (for supply, demand and flexibility) and establishing adequate remuneration to incentivise smart grid deployment.\n3\nModernisation and digitalisation are needed to improve the security and efficiency of electric grids, and reduce their costs\nChevron down\nThe complexity arising in the new power ecosystem requires strengthened pathways to digitalisation.

However, ABI forecasted that, by 2026, central management systems will connect to more than two-thirds of new LED streetlight installations.\nHow smart streetlights work\nThe technology behind smart streetlights can vary depending on its features and requirements, but typically, it involves a combination of cameras and sensors. When implemented on standard streetlights, these devices can detect movement that enables dynamic lighting and dimming. It also allows neighboring fixtures to communicate with each other. If a pedestrian or car is detected, all surrounding lights will brighten until movement is no longer captured.\nAdditional capabilities of smart streetlights may require more technology, such as image sensors, seismic sensors, sound sensors, speakers, weather and water detection sensors, and wireless transmitters.\nAfter smart streetlights are installed, most vendors offer software that can help cities monitor and manage the technology. This software can also be used to gather any data collected by the streetlights and adjust its features, such as dimming time.\nThe U.S. Federal Highway Administration has published guidelines on how government agen"},{"doc_id":"/Users/leo/lumi_project/data/smart_streetlight.txt","text":"can also be used to gather any data collected by the streetlights and adjust its features, such as dimming time.\nThe U.S. Federal Highway Administration has published guidelines on how government agencies can implement smart streetlights.\nFeatures of smart streetlights\nWhile the features of smart streetlights depend on the specific technology used by city planners, examples of common functionality include the following:\ndynamic lighting controls based on movement detection;\nenvironmental and weather monitoring;\ndigital signage that can update as needed, such as parking regulations or accident alerts;\nparking management, such as alerting officials of illegally parked vehicles or drivers of open spaces;\nextended cellular and wireless communications;\ntraffic management through real-time data feeds that track congestion and speed; and\nautomatic emergency response in the event of a car crash or crime.\nBenefits of smart streetlights\nImplementing smart streetlight systems offers the following advantages:\nreduced energy cost and usage with flexible dimming controls;\nincreased pedestrian satisfaction through improved safety measures;\nlowered repair and maintenance costs with the monitoring software;\nreduced carbon emissions and light pollution;\nincreased lamp life and shorter response times to outages;\nimproved architectural planning based on real traffic patterns and insights; and\nincreased revenue opportunities, such as leasing poles for digital signage or other services.\nDisadvanta"},{"doc_id":"/Users/leo/lumi_project/data/smart_streetlight.txt","text":"es to outages;\nimproved architectural planning based on real traffic patterns and insights; and\nincreased revenue opportunities, such as leasing poles for digital signage or other services.\nDisadvantages of smart streetlights\nDespite the long-term value in upgrading lighting networks, there are a few challenges. Although smart streetlights save money over time, the initial investment is a large one. Streetlighting costs can account for more than 40% of a city's energy costs -- although converting from halogen to basic LED luminaires yields up to 80% in instant savings.\nPlus, there are multiple applications and technology platforms, so choosing the right ones can be challenging. The lack of common standards across networks poses challenges as well.\nAnother barrier is the lack of consumer knowledge surrounding the features and benefits of smart streetlights. Lastly, implementing smart streetlights requires compliance with federal and utility regulations.\nExamples of smart streetlights\nCities investing in smart streetlights are chalking up gains. While Los Angeles received a revenue boost from SmartPoles, which offer Long-Term Evolution (LTE) reception and save energy, Chicago could save $10 million a year in energy costs, thanks to a four-year initiative to replace 270,000 city lights with LEDs and intelligent controls.

Additionally, cities in Spain have invested in green street lighting with the development of the wind-powered Eolgreen turbine lamppost.\nIn San Diego, sensor-laden smart streetlights have been installed to help direct drivers to vacant parking spaces and alert traffic enforcement officers to illegally parked cars. These intelligent fixtures can connect to systems to help determine which intersections are the most dangerous and need to be redesigned. Systems such as these could help municipalities adjust traffic signals by monitoring intersections and noting when traffic backs up, and sensors connected to the streetlights could also detect sounds such as gunfire, broken glass or a car crash.\nSoftware developers are creating apps using the data gathered by the streetlight internet of things (IoT) network. Emerging apps include one that identifies the quietest walking route; a \"digital cane\" for using traffic and location data to help visually impaired people cross the street; an app that enables food truck drivers to find locations with available parking spaces and high pedestrian traffic; and an app for identifying interesting events in real time.\nContinue Reading About smart streetlight\nLearn how to build smart city network backbone using smart streetlights\nSmart streetlights aid Oklahoma power company in keeping the lights on\nExplore how IoT is used for for sustainability in these 7 use cases\nHow utilities and their consumers can benef"},{"doc_id":"/Users/leo/lumi_project/data/smart_streetlight.txt","text":"mart streetlights\nSmart streetlights aid Oklahoma power company in keeping the lights on\nExplore how IoT is used for for sustainability in these 7 use cases\nHow utilities and their consumers can benefit from IoT\nPartnerships between cities and utility companies can unlock the power of community\nRelated Terms\nWhat is a smart city?\nA smart city is a municipality that uses information and communication technology to increase operational efficiency, share ...\nSee complete definition\nWhat is an embedded system?\nAn embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software designed for a specific function.\nSee complete definition\nWhat is brain-computer interface (BCI)?\nBrain-computer interface (BCI) is a device that translates signals in the brain to control some external activity.\nSee complete definition\nDig Deeper on IoT industry and vertical markets\nWhat is a smart city?\nBy:\nGavin Wright\nMore than 30 million smart street lights by 2023, predicts study\nBy:\nJoe O’Halloran\nSmart streetlights build smart city network backbone\nBy:\nSharon Shea\nImplementing IoT – overcoming barriers to commercial adoption\nBy:\nTim Wright\nSponsored News\nDriving Digital Transformation With Flexible IT from Dell and VMware\n–Dell Technologies\nImproving Operational Efficiencies: 4 Success Stories in Digital Transformation\n–Dell Technologies\nSee More\nVendor Resources\nComputer Weekly – 9 August 2016: Will Rio's 4G sink or swim?\n–TechTarget ComputerWeekly.com\nCW Benelux ezine August 2018\n–TechTarget Com"},{"doc_id":"/Users/leo/lumi_project/data/smart_streetlight.txt","text":"tal Transformation\n–Dell Technologies\nSee More\nVendor Resources\nComputer Weekly – 9 August 2016: Will Rio's 4G sink or swim?\n–TechTarget ComputerWeekly.com\nCW Benelux ezine August 2018\n–TechTarget ComputerWeekly.com\nLatest TechTarget\nresources\nCIO\nSecurity\nNetworking\nData Center\nData Management\nSearch\nCIO\nKey steps to developing a healthy risk culture\nSome companies fail to communicate that risk is every employee's business.
